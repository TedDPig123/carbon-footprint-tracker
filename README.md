## Features
### Activity Logging
You can log your daily activities with the "Log New Activity" module. Simply click on the plus button, choose the appropriate activity from the pop-up menu, fill in the specifics, and click add! If you want to remove any activity, click on the minus button on said activity. Additionally, you can view your progress from previous days by switching between dates!

### Goal Setting
It's important to set a goal for your carbon footprint each day, so you can click on 'Set Daily Goal' to do so! You can even set a different daily goal for each day. With each activity added, the goal module will update to reflect the amount of carbon you've generated and how much you've offset. A progress bar will also fill up to reflect how far you are from your daily limit.
